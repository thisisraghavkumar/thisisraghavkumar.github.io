I'm a first year MS student in The Pennsylvania State University, University Park in School of Engineering studying Computer Science & Engineering. Before resuming my academic journey I worked at Microsoft, Hyderabad for 4 years. You can find my resume [here](files/Resume_December_2024.pdf).

I love to read, especially about History and Economics to learn about how we got here. I would seriously recommend you to check out the works of Ayn Rand (The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged), Dale Carnegie (How to Win Friends and Influence People), [Acharya Prashant](https://acharyaprashant.org/) and [Everythis is Everything Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIG8a9wNRHVu-Aw2VgUJacXlpsJMbF5Y_)
